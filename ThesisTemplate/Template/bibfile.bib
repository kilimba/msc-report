extendible multidimensional array fies. For example, in satellite imagery and remote sensing, the datasets
are captured along defined swathes, defined spectral bands, time, etc. Some data processing application
subsequently require incremental tiling of adjacent scenes and progressive inclusion of selected bands.
The HDF5 and/or HDF-EOS data formats used in storing most of these remote sensing and satellite
images are essentially multidimensional array files where the dimensions of the datasets are defined by
the horizontal and elevations spatial coordinates, time, bands, etc. Progressive inclusion of adjacent tiles,
and selected bands amounts to extending an initial allocated array along the respective spatial dimensions
and spectral bands.
